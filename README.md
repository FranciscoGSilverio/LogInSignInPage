# LogInSignInPage
This repository was created to deploy the custom login page build with html and css

The login page was made during an HTML/CSS pratice in which I searched for a web page designed with Figma and tried to reproduce that using what I have learned so far.

The design I found was this one: https://www.figma.com/@tonyzebastian. I found that really interesting and tried my best to reproduce it the way is was created. 

Eventhough the original idea was to create a page just like the one in figma, I decided to change some things because of the short time I'd have to dedicate 
to this project, so it might not look exactly as in the original project.

Also, I added a footer just to add some extra information to the page such as my name, the designer name and the link to its original work and also my contacts.

If you'd like to take a look: here is the link to the deployed page: [franciscogsilverio.github.io/index.html](https://franciscogsilverio.github.io/index.html)

And of course, if you liked what you saw or have any ideas of improvement, feel free to let met know :)
